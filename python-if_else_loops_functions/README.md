1. for Loop
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or a range of numbers.
2. while Loop
The while loop repeats as long as a specified condition is True. It is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
3. if Statement
The if statement is used to execute code based on a condition. You can use elif (else if) and else to add more conditions.

These constructs are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program and handling repeated tasks or conditional operations in Python.
